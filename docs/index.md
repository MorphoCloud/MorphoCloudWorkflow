# MorphoCloud: On-Demand Cloud for 3D Slicer & SlicerMorph

MorphoCloud provides **on-demand cloud instances** and **reusable GitHub
workflows** to support computational morphology, 3D morphometrics, and
biomedical imaging research.

It allows researchers and educators to launch powerful
[JetStream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org/) virtual machines ‚Äî preloaded with
[3D Slicer](https://download.slicer.org) and
[SlicerMorph](https://SlicerMorph.org) ‚Äî by simply opening and commenting on
GitHub issues.

## ‚ú® What You Can Do with MorphoCloud

- **Run Slicer in your browser**: GPU-enabled remote desktops with up to 40GB
  GPUs and 1TB RAM.
- **Request and manage instances with GitHub Issues**: no portals, no manual
  provisioning.
- **Automated lifecycle management**: Create, shelve, unshelve, renew, or delete
  instances via simple `/commands`.
- **Integrate workflows into your project**: Use
  [MorphoCloudWorkflow](https://github.com/MorphoCloud/MorphoCloudWorkflow) to
  vendorize and customize provisioning logic for your community.
- **Support research and teaching**: Ideal for occasional high-performance
  computing needs in morphology and imaging.

## üîë Commands

Once approved, you can control your instance from the issue itself:

| Command            | Description                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `/create`          | Provision a new instance    |
| `/shelve`          | Suspend (turn off) instance |
| `/unshelve`        | Resume shelved instance     |
| `/delete_instance` | Delete an instance          |
| `/delete_volume`   | Remove associated storage   |
| `/renew`           | Extend lifespan by 4 hours  |
| `/email`           | Resend access email         |
